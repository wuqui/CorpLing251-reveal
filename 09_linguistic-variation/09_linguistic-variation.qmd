# Tag Questions

## What are tag questions?

. . .

- consist of an anchor clause + a tag
- subject in tag must be pronoun, *there*, or *one*
- verb in tag must be auxiliary or modal

![](att/tag-questions-canonical_1718893745563_0.png)

::: {.notes}
10:19–10:23 define tag questions, walk through canonical types
:::


## Polarity Patterns

- reversed polarity most common
    - `+ -`: *It's hot today, isn't it?*
    - `- +`: *It isn't working, is it?*
- constant positive and constant negative possible but rare
    - `+ +`: *She can drive, can she?*
    - `- -`: *He can't swim, can't he?*

::: {.notes}
10:23–10:26 explain polarity options with examples
:::


## Study background

Tottie, Gunnel, and Sebastian Hoffmann. 2006. ‘Tag Questions in British and American English’. Journal of English Linguistics 34 (4): 283–311. <https://doi.org/10.1177/0075424206294369>.

- compares tag questions in British (BNC-S) and American (LSAC) spoken corpora  
- examines form, polarity and pragmatic functions  
- explores sociolinguistic factors: gender, age, social class  
- finds tags about three times more frequent in British English, reversed polarity dominant (≈ 75 %)  
- women use tags more frequently and for facilitative purposes 


## Pragmatic Functions {.small}

![](att/tag-questions-functions-comparison_1718894372251_0.png)

___

- Informational
    - *You live in London, don't you?*
- Confirmatory
    - *This report was sent yesterday, wasn't it?*
- Facilitating
    - *Let's move on, shall we?*
- Attitudinal
    - *That was a fantastic game, wasn't it?*
- Peremptory
    - *Close the window, will you?*
- Aggressive
    - *You're going to mess this up again, aren't you?*

::: {.notes}
10:26–10:30 discuss pragmatic functions

## Study Questions {.small}

About the structure of tag questions:

1. How many false positives did your query return?
2. Which question tags are most frequent (e.g. *is n't it*, *are n't you*, etc.)?
3. Which pronouns are most frequent?
4. Which verbs are most frequent?
5. Are negated or positive tags more frequent?

About their use in different contexts:

6. How do tag questions differ in different age groups?
7. How do tag questions differ in different genders?
8. How do tag questions differ in different social classes?
9. How do tag questions differ in different educational levels?

Further study:

10. Which polarity patterns are most frequent? (e.g. `+ -` vs `- +`)


## Overview of steps

- [Retrieve tag question attestations](#retrieve-attestations)  
- [Evaluate false positives](#evaluate-false-positives)  
- [Frequency of tag forms, pronouns & verbs](#frequency-tag-forms)  
- [Distribution across metadata](#distribution-metadata)

::: {.notes}
10:55–10:57 outline task list
:::

___

## 1: Retrieve Attestations {#retrieve-attestations}

CQL query:

```
1:[lemma="be|do|have" | tag="MD"]  2:[lemma="not"]?   3:[tag="PP.?"] [word="\?"]
```

![](att/cql-builder.png)

___

### Hints

- You can exclude utterance-initial hits with `<u> []{1,} … within <u/>`.
- You can exclude preceding *wh*-words with `[lemma!="where|who|which|when"]`.
- You can exclude cases where a verb follows the pronoun immediately by adding `[tag!="V.*"]` after the pronoun in your pattern.
- You can exclude cases where an adjective follows the pronoun by adding `[tag!="J.*"]` after the pronoun.

::: {.notes}
10:57–11:05 demonstrate query building, students replicate
:::

___

## Step 2: Evaluate False Positives {#evaluate-false-positives}

- download a random sample of 50 hits
- annotate in Excel (`Label` column: 0 = false positive, 1 = true positive)
- refine the CQL query or use Excel filters to reduce noise.  
+ Model sheet (template): <https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvkgNVl9yS6aokmqDbTz5BmfbU6C>

::: {.notes}
11:05–11:12 walk through sampling & evaluation
:::


## Step 3: Frequency of Tag Forms {#frequency-tag-forms}

- most frequent complete tag phrases (*is n't it*, *are n't you*, etc.)
- most frequent pronouns 
- most frequent verbs 
- export frequency tables to Excel for charts

::: {.notes}
11:12–11:20 analyse frequency patterns
:::


## Step 4: Distribution across Metadata {#distribution-metadata}

cross-tabulate frequencies by

    - `Age range`
    - `Gender`
    - `Class: Social grade`
    - `Highest qualification`

::: {.notes}
11:20–11:30 explore sociolinguistic factors
:::


## Summary & Discussion

- compare BNC 2014 findings with @Tottie2006Tag
- reflect on methodological challenges (false positives, metadata)
- discuss potential research extensions
