    "text": "Potential cause: text type variation\n(Hilpert 2015, 187)\n\n“One explanation for the discrepancies between the tendencies in the Brown family of corpora and in the Time corpus is the composition of the respective corpora.\nWhereas the Brown corpora represent a balanced set of genres, the Time corpus represents a single text type.\nTo test whether genre differences explain the discrepancies, Millar (2009: 207) compares his Time results against an analysis of the press genres in the Brown and Frown corpora, finding, however, no satisfactory convergence between the two.\nMillar thus invokes sampling error as an explanation, which is criticized by Leech (2011a), who replicates the results from the Brown family of corpora on the basis of the balanced diachronic mega-corpora COCA and COHA (Davies 2008, 2010).\nThese results leave the frequency increases of can, could, and may in Time in need of an explanation, for which Leech (2011a: 557) suggests a genre-specific style change in journalistic writing.”"
