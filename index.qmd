This website contains all materials for the **Corpus Linguistics** seminar taught at LMU Munich during the 2025 summer semester.

# Course Overview

Corpus linguistics is an empirical approach to studying language that uses large collections of naturally occurring texts (corpora) to investigate linguistic patterns, variation, and change. This seminar provides hands-on experience with corpus methodologies and introduces students to cutting-edge research in the field.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Apply core corpus linguistic methods to investigate language use
- Use Sketch Engine for advanced corpus analysis
- Understand frequency effects and distributional patterns in language
- Analyse linguistic variation across social groups and text types
- Study language change using diachronic corpora
- Design and conduct independent corpus-based research

# Session Materials

The course covers advanced topics in corpus linguistics through practical applications:

### [Session 07: Syntax Analysis](07_syntax/07_syntax.html)
- Construction Grammar and corpus evidence
- Advanced CQL (Corpus Query Language) patterns
- Entrenchment and conventionalisation
- Syntactic frequency and usage-based grammar

### [Session 08: Research Projects](08_research-projects/08_research-projects.html)
- Term paper methodology and planning
- Research question formulation
- Corpus selection and design principles
- Statistical analysis and interpretation

### [Session 09: Linguistic Variation](09_linguistic-variation/09_linguistic-variation.html)
- Social factors in language use
- Tag questions and discourse functions
- Register and text type variation
- Sociolinguistic corpus analysis

### [Session 10: Language Change](10_language-change/10_language-change.html)
- Diachronic corpus methods
- Modal verbs and grammaticalisation
- S-curve models of language change
- Historical corpus analysis

### [Session 11: Course Wrap-up](11_wrap-up/11_wrap-up.html)
- Synthesis of key concepts and methods
- Research pathways and future directions
- Course reflection and feedback
