# Language Change

## What is language change?

. . .

- systematic modifications in language over time
- affects all linguistic levels: phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics

**Examples**

. . .

- **phonology**: *knight* /naɪt/ vs Middle English /kniçt/
- **morphology**: *you* (singular) replacing *thou*/*thee*
- **syntax**: *do*-support in questions (*Do you know?* vs *Know you?*)
- **semantics**: *nice* shifting from 'foolish' to 'pleasant'

→ corpus linguistics provides empirical evidence for change

::: {.notes}
10:19–10:22 introduce language change concepts
:::


## Research Questions in Language Change

- **What** changes? → linguistic features
    - word order patterns: *do*-support in questions (*Do you know?* vs *Know you?*)
    - use of modal verbs: *must* declining from 2000 to 500 per million words 
- **When** does it change? → timing and pace
    - *thou*/*thee* disappears rapidly in 17th century
    - gradual decline of *shall* over 200 years
- **How** does it change? → mechanisms and patterns
    - example: grammaticalization of *going to* → *gonna*
    - concrete: *have to* replaces *must* in obligation contexts

___

- **Who** changes? → social factors
    - factors: age groups, social classes, gender differences
    - example: younger speakers use *gonna* more than older speakers
- **Why** does it change? → causes and motivations
    - factors: social prestige, language contact, simplification
    - example: *ain't* stigmatised, speakers switch to *isn't*

## Corpus Methods for Language Change

- **Diachronic corpora**: e.g. EEBO, COHA, Gutenberg, COCA, NOW, English Trends
- **Frequency analysis**: absolute and relative frequencies over time
- **Text type variation**: register-specific changes
- **Collocation analysis**: changing semantic associations
- **Statistical measures**: coefficient of variation, significance testing

::: {.notes}
10:25–10:28 discuss methodological approaches

# Modal Verbs in English

## Theoretical Background: @Hilpert2015Grammatical

> Another domain of English grammar that is currently undergoing change is the domain of modality, specifically the modal auxiliaries. In the most general of terms, the situation is that several of the core modal auxiliaries are declining in text frequency (Leech 2003; Mair 2006), while at the same time new quasi-modal elements are undergoing grammaticalization (Krug 2000).

**Key question**: Why certain forms decline while others rise?


## Core vs Peripheral Modal Verbs

. . .

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Core Modal Verbs**

- *will*, *would*
- *can*, *could*
- *may*, *might*

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Peripheral Modal Verbs**

- *BE going to*
- *have to*
- *got to*
- *need to*

## Frequency Changes Over Time

## Interaction between frequency changes and causes

[@Hilpert2015Grammatical, p. 186]

“The result is a dynamic situation that raises a number of questions. 

- For instance, it has been asked **why** certain forms are in decline whereas others are on the upswing. 
- Is there a relation between these developments, and if so, how do we assign the **roles of cause and effect**?”


## Potential cause: text type variation

[@Hilpert2015Grammatical, p. 187]

::: {.incremental}
- “One explanation for the discrepancies between the tendencies in the Brown family of corpora and in the Time corpus is the **composition** of the respective corpora. 
- Whereas the Brown corpora represent a **balanced** set of genres, the Time corpus represents a **single text type**. 
- To test whether genre differences explain the discrepancies, Millar (2009: 207) compares his **Time** results against an analysis of the press genres in the **Brown** and **Frown** corpora, finding, however, no satisfactory convergence between the two. 
- Millar thus invokes **sampling error** as an explanation, which is criticized by Leech (2011a), who replicates the results from the Brown family of corpora on the basis of the balanced **diachronic mega-corpora COCA and COHA** (Davies 2008, 2010). 
- These results leave the frequency increases of *can*, *could*, and *may* in Time in need of an explanation, for which Leech (2011a: 557) suggests a **genre-specific style change** in journalistic writing.”

# Practice: Corpus Analysis

## Study objectives

1. **Frequency analysis**: track modal verb usage over time in COHA
2. **Text type variation**: examine register preferences in COCA

    - `can_v _v`
    - `will_v _v`
    - `may_v _v`
    - `shall_v _v`
    - `must_v _v`
- **peripheral**:

## Step 3: Statistical Analysis

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)

**Definition**: Statistical measure describing relative variability of data

$$ 
\begin{align}
CV &= \left( \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \right) \times 100 \\
   &= \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100
\end{align}
$$

### Excel Calculation

- Column 1: **Mean**: `=AVERAGE(range)` 
- Column 2: **Standard Deviation**: `=STDEV.S(range)` 
- Column 3: **CV**: `=(STDEV/MEAN)*100`

## Study questions

1. Which modal verbs show the strongest frequency changes?
    - Are there differences between core and peripheral modals?
3. Which modals show the highest text type variation?
    - Are there differences between core and peripheral modals?
3. How do frequency changes relate to text type preferences?


# Summary

- modal verbs show systematic frequency changes
    - several core modals are declining
    - peripheral modals are rising
- language change and text type variation seem to be related (in the case of modals)
- corpus methods provide empirical evidence
