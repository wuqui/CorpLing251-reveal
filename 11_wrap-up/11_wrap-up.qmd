# A Recap of what we've done

## Sessions 01-06: Foundations & Core Methods

::: {.notes}
10:50–10:55 (5 min) - Recap foundational sessions
:::

**Building the foundation**

. . .

1. Organisation & introduction to corpus linguistics
2. Sketch Engine skills (concordancing, frequency)
3. Lexical innovation & diffusion patterns
4. Morphology & word-formation processes
5. Meaning analysis, collocations, word sketches (*clipping* study, @Hilpert2023Meaning)
6. Creating corpora (principles & practice)

. . .

→ **Core skills acquired**: corpus search, frequency analysis, morphological investigation, corpus design

## Sessions 07-10: Advanced Applications

::: {.notes}
10:55–11:00 (5 min) - Recap advanced sessions
:::

**From methods to research**

. . .

7. Syntax analysis (constructions, CQL, entrenchment research)
8. Research project planning & term paper methodology  
9. Linguistic variation (tag questions, social factors)
10. Language change (modal verbs, diachronic analysis)

. . .

→ **Research skills developed**: syntactic investigation, sociolinguistic analysis, historical corpus research, project design

# Key Concepts Synthesis

## Corpus Linguistics as Method & Theory

::: {.notes}
11:00–11:05 (5 min) - Synthesise theoretical frameworks
:::

**What we've learnt about corpus linguistics**

. . .

- **Empirical foundation**: language use patterns in large datasets
- **Frequency effects**: usage frequency shapes linguistic structure
- **Contextual meaning**: distributional semantics and collocational profiles
- **Variation & change**: systematic patterns across time, space, social groups

. . .

**Theoretical frameworks encountered:**

- **Construction Grammar** (syntax study, Session 07)
- **Principle of No Synonymy** (clipping study, Session 05)  
- **Entrenchment & Conventionalisation** (syntactic patterns, Session 07)
- **Sociolinguistic variation theory** (tag questions, Session 09)

## Language Levels & Phenomena

::: {.notes}
11:05–11:10 (5 min) - Consolidate linguistic levels covered
:::

**Corpus methods across linguistic levels**

. . .

| Level | Phenomena | Methods | Focus |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Lexis** | Innovation, diffusion | Frequency tracking, diachronic analysis | Patterns of lexical change |
| **Morphology** | Word-formation, clipping | Collocational analysis, meaning comparison | Form-meaning relationships |
| **Syntax** | Constructions, CQL patterns | Frequency analysis, entrenchment measures | Usage-based grammar |
| **Sociolinguistics** | Variation, change | Social factor analysis, diachronic comparison | Language and society |

. . .

→ **Corpus linguistics = versatile methodology** across all language levels

# Methods & Tools

## Technical Skills Acquired

::: {.notes}
11:10–11:15 (5 min) - Consolidate practical skills
:::

**Your corpus linguistics toolkit**

. . .

**Search & Analysis:**

- **Sketch Engine**: concordancing, frequency lists, word sketches
- **CQL (Corpus Query Language)**: advanced pattern searches
- **Collocational analysis**: meaning through co-occurrence
- **Diachronic comparison**: tracking change over time

. . .

**Research Design:**

- **Corpus selection**: appropriate data for research questions
- **Hypothesis formation**: testable predictions about language use
- **Statistical interpretation**: frequency patterns and significance
- **Critical evaluation**: corpus limitations and biases

## From Data to Insights

::: {.notes}
11:15–11:20 (5 min) - Connect methods to research process
:::

**The corpus research process you've mastered**

. . .

1. **Research question formulation** → clear, testable hypotheses
2. **Corpus selection** → appropriate data for your question  
3. **Query design** → CQL and search strategies
4. **Data extraction** → concordances, frequency lists, collocations
5. **Pattern analysis** → quantitative and qualitative interpretation
6. **Contextual interpretation** → linguistic and social meaning
7. **Critical reflection** → methodological limitations and insights

. . .

→ **You can now conduct independent corpus-based research**

# Research Pathways & Future Directions

## Contemporary Corpus Linguistics

::: {.notes}
11:20–11:25 (5 min) - Current trends and future possibilities
:::

**Where corpus linguistics is heading**

. . .

**Technological advances:**

- **Large language models** and corpus data
- **Multimodal corpora** (text, speech, video)
- **Real-time corpus compilation** (social media, web scraping)
- **Automated annotation** (parsing, semantic tagging)

. . .

**Emerging research areas:**

- **Digital humanities** applications
- **Forensic linguistics** and authorship analysis
- **Second language acquisition** and learner corpora
- **Computational sociolinguistics** and social media analysis


# Course Feedback & Reflection
