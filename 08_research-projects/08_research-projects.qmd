# Research Areas & Topics

::: {.notes}
11:15–11:28
:::

Some broad areas you could focus on.

::: {.incremental}
- **Linguistic Variation**: How does language vary between speakers, text types, or geographical regions?
    - **speaker variation**: e.g., tag questions across age, gender, social class
    - **text type/register variation**: e.g., modal verb frequency in academic vs. fiction
    - **geographical variation**: e.g., *fall* vs. *autumn*
- **Language Change**: How does language change over time?
    - **lexical change**: rise of neologisms such as *hangry*
    - **semantic change**: shift in collocates, cf. *gay*
    - **grammatical change**: diffusion of constructions along an **S-curve** (e.g. *going to* future)
:::

___

## Example: Geographical Variation

::: {.notes}
11:25–11:28
:::

Frequency of *fall* vs. *autumn* by country in the NOW corpus.

## Example: Language Change

:::

![](att/image_1718316357300_0.png)

___

## Theoretical Frameworks

::: {.notes}
11:28–11:40
:::

Your research can be grounded in various theoretical frameworks:

- **Usage-based approaches**: How do patterns of language use shape grammar and meaning?
- **S-Curve Model**: How do linguistic innovations spread through a community?
- **Entrenchment-and-Conventionalization Model**: How do novel expressions become fixed conventions?
- **Distributional Hypothesis**: How can we understand the meaning of a word by looking at the contexts in which it appears?

___

## Domains of Language

### Lexis

::: {.notes}
11:36–11:39
:::

- The study of **vocabulary**, including its innovation and diffusion.
- **Neologisms** are new words or expressions.
- Can you think of recent examples?
    - *staycation*, *glamping*, *hangry*, *cringe*, *social distancing*, *medfluencer*
- These can be investigated by looking at their **frequency over time** (e.g., in the *English Trends* corpus) or their **distribution across text types** (e.g., in *enTenTen*).

___

### Morphology

::: {.notes}
11:39–11:41
:::

- The study of **word formation** and internal structure.
- **Clipping** is a common word-formation process where a word is shortened.
- For example, *brother* becomes *bro*, or *refrigerator* becomes *fridge*.
- **Research questions** could explore:
    - Do source words and clipped forms differ in meaning?
    - How does their usage vary across text types or over time?
    - A corpus-based analysis could compare their frequency, collocations, and word sketches.

___

### Syntax & Semantics

::: {.notes}
11:41–11:43
:::

- **Syntax**: The study of sentence structure.
    - An example topic is the study of a specific grammatical construction, like the *the N BE that* construction (e.g., "The problem is that...").
- **Semantics**: The study of meaning.
    - An example topic is semantic change, where you could investigate how the meaning of a word has evolved over time by analysing its changing collocates.

___

# Data, Corpora & Methods

::: {.notes}
11:43–11:45
:::

- **Corpora**
    - **Sketch Engine**: Gutenberg English 2020, EEBO, enTenTen20, English Trends
    - **english-corpora.org**: COHA, COCA, NOW
- **Methods**
    - Frequency
    - Collocations
    - Word Sketches

:::

- **Group task**: draft a mini study plan for one research area and add one slide to the shared deck: <https://1drv.ms/p/c/9a2ec97d593520f9/EUu0cQtCO1pMnlyH0FZKnRMBFWa2hCajBPKjPBhkbnPZog>
- **Template (fill on your slide)**:
    - Research question
    - Hypothesis (optional)
    - Corpus / data
    - Method(s)
    - Expected finding(s)
- **During plenary (last 8 min)**:
    - each group presents their slide (≈ 60 s)
    - audience notes one idea or question
    - quick Q&A if time permits

___

## Summary

- A strong **research question** is the compass of your study – keep asking *why* and *how*.
- **Map the literature** first, then locate your own contribution.
- Let the research question choose the **corpus**, not the other way round.
- Plan **methods** early, keep them transparent and replicable.
- **Write clearly**: main point in main clause, verbs over nouns.
- Today's **pitch and design drafts** are seeds – **Keep working** towards your term paper!
